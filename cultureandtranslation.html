<h4>Learning About Cultures and Translation</h4>

<p>In international technical communication, writing for translation is an especially important factor that is often overlooked. By understanding the linguistic and translational needs of an audience, a technical writer can avoid additional costs and labor, and even hazards or safety concerns due to miscommunications or improper design for other structurally different language translations (Urban, 5-6). This concept applies also to visual communication through imagery and symbolism&mdash;should a technical communicator not prepare for the alteration of images or graphics for different cultural audiences, visual communications may be mistranslated or misunderstood (Risku). Agboka has written extensively on the need to further shift international technical communication into a role of social justice and understanding towards local communities and disenfranchised groups. Much research is done into localization and translation within large European nations; however, many African and South American nations do not receive the same attention. Similarly, technical communication can often fall victim to what he defines as <q>large culture ideologies,</q> which make assumptions and ignore the misunderstandings between cultures (Agboka 159). </p>

<p>Furthermore, many argue the importance of teaching intercultural communication specifically as a tool for technical communicators. Flammia (2005), Cleary (2010), Thatcher (2017), Chong (2012), Matveeva (2005) have each presented compelling arguments for the importance of teaching future technical communicators the skills needed to communicate with audiences of different languages and cultures. Both Flammia and Cleary have written about international student projects&mdash;while Cleary&#39;s work discussed the skills students need in order to communicate with those of different cultural backgrounds while addressing ethics, legal issues, humor, and writing style, Flammia&#39;s work has discussed documentation and cultural norms between countries and the need for writing for translation. Chong&#39;s work similarly reviews international collaboration and communication in terms of usability testing across an international audience. Thatcher and Matveeva provide in-depth recommendations for how to approach teaching international technical communication to avoid stereotypes and promote collaboration and growth. </p>

<h6>Teaching About Cultures</h6>
<p class="rightpquote">Hypertext, when combined with such multicultural content, provides an introductory learning experience that can help with intercultural communication.</p>
<p>	Many traditional methods of teaching culture and language are no longer relevant or compatible with students&#39; personal experiences and background knowledge. Irwin, Moore, and Stevenson (1994) suggest the efficacy of a hypertext program called <q>Multicultural Links.</q> This database served as a resource for teachers and students to access pictures, texts, maps, as well as music and languages from different cultures. Because understanding culture is an important step to growing into a role in international technical communication, it is important to first have an appropriate and technologically relevant source to access such a large collection of multicultural materials. Tools like these are often some of the first experiences young students have with other languages and cultures. This paper aligns with the values of technical communication in its stance that one must understand their audience&#39;s views and backgrounds in order to effectively reach them in a meaningful way. In this case, that means providing a more customizable and accessible approach to educational tools and information. Hypertext allows for such individualized methods of learning, by creating non-linear links of information, which in turn makes learning more interesting, as you can choose to follow the paths that interest you. Understanding the importance of hypertext in how we understand and learn about new cultures and languages is now imperative.</p>


<p>This idea is still relevant, and twenty-five years later, Bourina and Dunaeva (2019) similarly discuss the ways hypertext creates learning environments that influence and encourage communicative competence, as well as multicultural communication and linguistics. Learning new languages is ever prominent in today&#39;s globalized world, and the authors argue that hypertext only aides in the ability to learn these skills.
