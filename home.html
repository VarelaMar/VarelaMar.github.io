<h4>Introduction to Intercultural Communication and Hypertext</h4>
<p>As we continue to globalize the field of technical communication, we must also continue to study the way we learn about these new cultures and languages that we come across through our audiences, and how digital literacy and rhetoric play a role in the way we communicate across hypertext. Rhetoric and digital literacy vary across borders, and it is important to understand how intercultural communication works before working in international technical communication.</p>
<p class="rightpquote">Understanding and appreciating other cultures is just one step necessary for succeeding in effective international or intercultural communication.</p>
<p>This site will also discuss the role of hypertext in teaching and learning about new languages and cultures, as learning about a people and their language is often one of many steps necessary for international communication. If the goal of technical communication is to communicate accurately and effectively, then, today especially, the goal should also be to understand how to communicate with those of other cultural beliefs and languages.</p>

It is important to understand how to navigate these differences when communicating interculturally.</p>
