    <h4>Introduction to Intercultural Communication and Hypertext</h4>

    <p>
      As we continue to globalize the field of technical communication, we must also continue
      to study the way we learn about these new cultures and languages that we come across through
      our audiences, and how digital literacy and rhetoric play a role in the way we communicate
      across hypertext.

    <p class="rightpquote">
      Understanding and appreciating other cultures is just one step necessary for succeeding in
      effective international or intercultural communication.

      This site will also discuss the role of hypertext in teaching and learning about new languages
      and cultures, as learning about a people and their language is often one of many steps necessary
      for international communication.
