      When discussing intercultural communication and hypertext, it is important to look at the role rhetoric plays and how it may differ. Thatcher goes beyond existing research on writing and argues that hypertext also determines mental and rhetorical patterns. He discusses hypertext through three intercultural and cross-cultural systems: individualism–collectivism, universal–particular, and high context–low context.

      Hypertext stands out among writing, orality, and even email due to its globalized and complex format that contains more colors, sounds, graphics, and information than many other forms of communication. Visual forms of communication play a large role in audience understanding and can greatly affect interpretation. Hypertext also reflects its own form of rhetoric with formatting, individualization, and limitless pathways—links and complex webs that lack linearity make hypertext rhetoric different from traditional rhetorical patterns. Thatcher considers hypertext rhetoric more public in nature than email and writing.

      Finally, when it comes to rhetoric and international/intercultural communication, the rhetoric of other languages must also be considered. By understanding how rhetoric and language differ between cultures, technical communicators can create <q>translation-friendly text</q> by taking language and translation into account before editing or translating a document.
