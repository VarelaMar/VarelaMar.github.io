<h4>Rhetoric</h4>

<p>When discussing intercultural communication and hypertext, it is also important to look at the role rhetoric plays and how it may differ. Thatcher goes beyond the existing research which focuses on writing and argues that hypertext also determines mental and rhetorical patterns. He discusses hypertext through the following three intercultural and cross-cultural systems: individualism&mdash;collectivism, universal&mdash;particular, and high context&mdash;low context. In this article, hypertext stands out among writing, orality, and even email, due to its globalized and complex format that contains more colors, sounds, graphics, and information than many other forms of communication. As stated earlier, these visual forms of communication play a large role in the audience&#39;s understanding of communication and can greatly affect the way a person interprets a message (Risku, Thatcher). Furthermore, hypertext reflects its own form of rhetoric with its formatting, individualization, and limitless pathways&mdash;these links and complex webs being the lack of linearity that make hypertext rhetoric different from traditionally communicated rhetorical patterns. Thatcher considers the rhetoric of hypertext to be more public in nature than email and writing, which can sometimes have a more private characteristic. Again, he references hypertext&#39;s lack of linearity as an audience-driven and metaphorical mode of communication, with many contextualized links and groups within itself (310).  </p>

<p>Finally, when it comes to rhetoric and international or intercultural communication, the rhetoric of other languages must also be taken into account. By understanding the ways rhetoric and language differ between cultures, technical communicators can create <q>translation-friendly text</q> by taking the language and translation into account before editing or translating the document. For example, Urban notes that many rhetorical and linguistic devices commonly used in English simply cannot translate into many other languages&mdash;passive voice, prepositions, phrasal verbs, and metaphors are a few of the linguistic tools that often do not translate. Urban recommends avoiding these in technical writing for an international audience, as the cultural differences in direct translations could cause harm and miscommunication (5-6). </p>
