<h4>Digital Literacy and Rhetoric</h4>

<p>One multicultural online environment conducive to communication across cultures is an online forum. One study on transcultural digital literacies that I find to be extremely interesting is Kim&#39;s 2015 study of online forums about Korean dramas and pop culture. Rather than taking a formal approach to conducting research within a school or other educational setting, Kim takes an ethnographic approach to study the way people communicate interculturally online, making for very relevant research in today&#39;s world. </p>

<p>The spread and popularity of Korean music and popular culture provides the opportunity to view multicultural learning in action and examine how transcultural digital literacies highlight the ways people of all different backgrounds communicate with one another internationally and through hypertext.
	This study provides qualitative evidence of the ways digital communication impact cultural learning, intercultural communication, and transcultural digital literacy. Kim challenges the traditional educational curricula that define ethnicity as a <q>rigid identity construct,</q> and argues that by practicing transcultural digital literacies, more flexible understandings can be learned. People can choose to experience and learn from cultures that they may not have access to outside of hypertext. Online forums further this, as people around the world from different demographics and backgrounds share a space for shared interests, but also for learning about new cultures and new identities. </p>
<p class="rightpquote">Digital literacy may be impacted by background and environment, meaning a technical writer cannot assume accessibility and understanding without first knowing how to communicate interculturally with different groups.</p>
  <p>Within online communications studies, much research focuses on individual communications or solely on Western sites and discussion boards. Kim deviates from this, examining how young people across the globe learn about themselves and others as they informally learn about new traditions and beliefs by gaining transcultural digital literacy. The conversations had in this Korean popular culture online forum are personalized and in-depth, allowing for greater understanding among different groups. It is my belief that ethnographic research is the best way to learn about and understand the values of one&#39;s audience. Through studying the DramaCrazy online forum, the data collected among Americans, Koreans, and those of other nationalities proved how such interaction can impact intercultural communication. Discussions included cultural traditions, like whether or not alcohol is prevalent in the members&#39; respective cultures, self-representations and religious discussion, and personal stories about members&#39; lives and families. These personalized and unique conversations show how transcultural digital literacies have taken our hypertext and digital world and created improved intercultural communication. The space is dynamic and allows for imaginative learning in a multicultural setting. </p>

<h6>Cross-Cultural Digtial Literacy</h6>
<p>Digital literacy has also been examined cross-culturally by Matheson (2019) and Hamutoglu et al. (2020). With the rise of the technical communication field in India, Matheson compares the priorities of technical communicators in India with those in the United States. They found that while both groups of technical communicators in the study were adapting to new technologies, many of the practitioners noted the need for understanding things like coding and programming (98). Their findings found similarities between the two fields and bridged an intercultural understanding in order to effectively work together internationally.
 	Hamutoglu et. al. examined the differences in digital literacy between university students from the United Kingdom, Malta, and Turkey. They reviewed the students&#39; digital literacy cognitively, technically, and by gender. While their findings did not show significant differences between gender in any of their countries, they did note digital literacy and internet usage and access varied within the countries themselves, showing that digital literacy is not a standard within a nation, and digital literacy will vary greatly between different communities and cultures. Showing how digital literacy varies so greatly even within one nation shows the need for understanding the intercultural differences and relationships between audiences. </p>
