<h4>Teaching Languages</h4>

<p class="rightpquote">The foreign language segment of hypertext network is a special interactive environment for cognitive activity. As a result, students participate in real communication. At the same time, students can establish a multi-level link between pieces of textual information; think of original ways to make use of a variety of linguistic, sociocultural, methodological materials taken from the network. (Bourina and Dunaeva 11)
</p>

<p>Bourina and Dunaeva describe hypertext as a cultural, psychological, linguistic, informational learning environment that is essentially an <q>information picture</q> of our world (111). The diverse and expansive nature of hypertext allows for new forms of communication and new semantic spaces. Students gain new mechanisms for experiencing and learning languages. <q><a href="glossary.html#link5">Multiliteracy</a></q> defines the skills needed to navigate hypertext in <q>social, cultural, and methodological aspects.</q> Currently, the European educational system defines multiliteracy in its goal statement (112). </p>

<p> Not only does hypertext allow us to experience new languages and ways of communication, but hypertext defines modern language and influences language acquisition (112). By acquiring these different communication patterns, we learn a <q>secondary linguistic personality,</q> which allows humans to interact through intercultural communication. The authors define hypertext as a <q>training environment</q> for this secondary linguistic personality and a way to interact within the socio-cultural context of a foreign culture by searching and analyzing new types of concepts and patterns. The complexity of hypertext allows students to build their own learning structures, define their own goals and educational interests, and learn content of a foreign culture with references in authentic materials (114). </p>


<p>The linking to new sources and multimedia nature of hypertext allows for a greater opportunity to practice and learn <q><a href="glossary.html#link1">communicative competence</a>.</q> This combination of interaction and new information leads to diversified connections with intercultural content. The authors continue, <q>As a result, hypertext information blocks become for an individual a means of information exchange with the surrounding world. This exchange makes possible not only assimilation and transmission of information, but also helps to understand and <q>accept</q> a foreign culture</q> (111). These skills benefit from the nature of hypertext, and international technical communication benefits from the access and ability to practice these communicative competences.</p>
